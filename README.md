# Movies-ETL

# Summary 
Amazing Prime requested a clean database for movie ratings data and movie data in PostgreSQL for working use. In order to accomplish this, data files from Wikipedia, Kaggle metadata and MovieLens rating data was processed using ETL (Extract, Load and Transform). The cleaned and merged relevant data from Wikipedia and Kaggle metadata was saved and transfered to PostgreSQL as movies and the Movielens data was cleaned and transferred to PostgreSQL as ratings.
